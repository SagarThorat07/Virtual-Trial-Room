# Virtual-Trial-Room
Virtual Trial Rooms are augmented reality digital trial rooms for  humans to try various clothing digitally, instead of trying on in real life.  Virtual try- on technology lets customers see how clothes fit  themselves or an avatar, allowing them to virtually try on clothing  before purchasing them, with the help of OpenCV (computer vision)
